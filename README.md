I'm a statistician and have worked on
survey sampling/weighting, causal inference,
AI fairness, privacy, and predictive modeling.


## Selected work

### At Meta/Facebook

> Meta created [a system to ensure ads are delivered fairly to different demographic groups](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/advertising-fairness-variance-reduction-system-vrs/), as part of its [settlement with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/01/an-update-on-our-ads-fairness-efforts/). I proposed the measurement metric (shuffle distance) and the Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms.
